## TL;DR (Architecture in One Screen)

- Goal: Emergent, socially believable NPC dynamics via lossy information + biased inference (not scripted trees).
- Core Cognitive Loop: Physiology ‚ûú Expression ‚ûú Distorted Perception ‚ûú Biased Belief Update ‚ûú Desire/Intent ‚ûú Action.
- Information Rule: Agents never read another agent's ground‚Äëtruth internals; only their own perceived/derived model.
- Data Shape: Type-safe `Normalized` values for all [0.0, 1.0] ranges; continuous numeric fields for ML integration.
- ECS Style: Domain-based plugin architecture + event-driven systems (`Entity` IDs in events; fresh lookup via
  `query.get`).
- Type Safety: Zero-cost `Normalized` wrapper prevents invalid states while maintaining f32 performance.
- Test Organization: Comprehensive test suite in `src/tests/` organized by domain.
- Simulation Scaling Vision: Many headless Bevy zone workers + SpaceTimeDB persistence layer (later stage).
- ML Readiness: Observation vectors = flattened component sets; hooks at desire arbitration, action selection, belief
  reinforcement.

## Overview

Artificial Society is a research-focused Rust/Bevy simulation probing whether players can apply authentic human social
intuition when facing AI agents‚Äîoccasionally feeling uncertainty about whether an entity is human‚Äë or AI‚Äëcontrolled.
Believability emerges not from perfect cognition but from *structured imperfection*: limited perception, biased
updating, noisy expression, and asymmetric information propagation.

This repository implements the foundational architecture with a type-safe `Normalized` wrapper system, comprehensive
domain-based plugin architecture, and organized test structure. The four-layer communication pipeline is being
built on this solid foundation with strict separation between current and historical approaches.

---

## Foundational Principles

1. **Mantle of Ignorance**: No omniscience; perception components are the only ingress of external world data.
2. **Type Safety**: `Normalized` wrapper enforces [0.0, 1.0] bounds at compile-time, preventing invalid states.
3. **Event-Driven Reactivity**: Prefer events over polling (neuron metaphor; cache-friendly targeted lookups).
4. **Domain Plugin Architecture**: Each AI domain (cognition, perception, physiology, social) is a self-contained plugin.
5. **Equality of Potential**: Identical cognitive substrate across all agents; divergence via learned/experienced weights.
6. **Data-Oriented Design**: Type-safe numeric fields; minimized branching; zero-cost abstractions.
7. **Continuous Social State**: Emotions/attitudes/intent as continuous `Normalized` vectors, not enums.
8. **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive test suite in `src/tests/` organized by domain.
9. **Documentation Hierarchy**: Clear separation between current specification and historical approaches.

## Current Milestone Focus

**Foundation Phase Complete**: Type-safe architecture with `Normalized` wrapper system and comprehensive plugin structure.

**Current Focus**: Milestone 1 (Expressive Agent) implementation:

- ‚úÖ **Type-Safe Foundation**: `Normalized` wrapper prevents invalid states, replaces manual validation
- ‚úÖ **Plugin Architecture**: Domain-based plugins (cognition, perception, physiology, social) with comprehensive documentation
- ‚úÖ **Test Infrastructure**: Organized test suite in `src/tests/` with 12 passing tests
- üîÑ **Expression Mapping**: Map physiological + internal modulators ‚ûú outward expression vector
- üîÑ **Perception Pipeline**: Implement attention-weighted, noisy perception with biased reconstruction

---

## Layered Communication Model

Internal Truth ‚ûú Expression ‚ûú Perception ‚ûú Inference ‚ûú (Feedback into desires & planned actions)

- Layer 1: Private internal state (needs, stress, proto-emotions, memory indices).
- Layer 2: Expression transform exposes only *projected* approximations (lossy, rate-limited).
- Layer 3: Perception reconstructs with attention constraints + noise + prior-driven bias.
- Layer 4: Inference attributes intent / reputation updates (with systematic error).

Emergent outcomes: miscommunication loops, reputation drift, emotional contagion, proto-cultural stratification.

## Type-Safe Architecture Highlights

### `Normalized` Wrapper System

The project now uses a comprehensive type-safe `Normalized` wrapper for all [0.0, 1.0] values:

```rust
// OLD: Manual validation prone to errors
pub struct Needs {
    pub hunger: f32,  // Could be set to invalid values
}
needs.hunger = 2.0;  // Compiles but invalid!

// NEW: Type-safe with automatic bounds enforcement
pub struct Needs {
    pub hunger: Normalized,  // Cannot store invalid values
}
needs.hunger += 2.0;  // Automatically clamped to 1.0
```

**Benefits:**
- **Zero-cost abstraction**: Same memory layout as f32
- **Compile-time safety**: Invalid states are impossible
- **Automatic clamping**: All arithmetic operations maintain bounds
- **Bevy integration**: Full Component and Reflect support
- **Comprehensive tests**: 12 tests covering all operations

### Removed Deprecated Code

- ‚ùå **`clamped_setters!` macro**: Replaced by type-safe `Normalized` fields
- ‚ùå **Manual validation utilities**: `quantized_to_float`, `float_to_quantized` (now type methods)
- ‚ùå **Legacy utility functions**: Replaced by `Normalized` arithmetic operations
- ‚úÖ **Kept validation macros**: For testing and external input validation

---

## Install & Run

Prerequisites: Recent Rust toolchain (Rust 2024 edition compatible with Bevy 0.16.x).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maxjonata/Artificial-Culture-Rust-.git
cd Artificial-Culture-Rust-
cargo run --release
```

Use `--release` for stable frame pacing. If dynamic linking issues arise on your platform, remove the `dynamic_linking`
feature in `Cargo.toml` and rebuild.

---

## Runtime Usage

Current prototype: spawns agents; early interaction visualization. Expect rapid iteration & breaking API changes.

Quick Notes:

- Toggle inspector (EGUI) to inspect and tweak numeric component fields.
- Observe downstream propagation (e.g., altering needs should eventually affect expression vector once pipeline
  solidifies).

---

## Documentation Map

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Documentation Hierarchy**

**PRIMARY SOURCES (Authoritative for Current Development):**
- **Main Specification**: `Docs/Fundaments/Artificial Society_ Complete Technical and Philosophical Specification.md`
- **Implementation Roadmap**: `Docs/Fundaments/DETAILED_ROADMAP.md`
- **Game Design Document**: Based on the above two files (when created)

**RESEARCH SOURCES (For Parameter Values & Design Inspiration):**
- **Academic Papers**: `Docs/Papers/` - Use for realistic parameter values and behavioral patterns, NOT for achieving scientific perfection

**HISTORICAL/BACKSTORY DOCUMENTATION (Reference Only - Not for Current Development):**
- ECS Structures: `Docs/Structures/` - **Historical approaches, superseded by main specification**
- Flows & Roadmap: `Docs/Flows/` - **Legacy planning documents, superseded by main specification**
- Theoretical Grounding: `Docs/Fundaments/neurological.md`, `psychological.md`, `sociological.md` - **Historical research notes**

**‚ö†Ô∏è AI Development Notice**: AI assistants should ONLY use the Primary Sources for current development guidance. All other documentation represents historical approaches and lessons learned, preserved for reference but not for active development.

---

## Design Invariants

- **Type Safety**: All [0.0, 1.0] values use `Normalized` wrapper to prevent invalid states at compile-time.
- **Mantle of Ignorance**: No direct access to another agent's internal ground-truth state.
- **Event-Driven**: Events carry only identifiers; receivers fetch authoritative state at handling time.
- **Pure Components**: Components are data containers (`#[derive(Component, Debug, Reflect, Default)]`).
- **Continuous Representation**: Social/emotional constructs as `Normalized` vectors, not enums.
- **Domain Plugins**: Each AI domain (cognition, perception, physiology, social) is self-contained.
- **Test Coverage**: All core functionality has comprehensive tests in `src/tests/`.
- **Documentation Hierarchy**: Clear separation between current specification and historical approaches.

---

## ML Integration Trajectory

- Observation Vector: Concatenate normalized component fields (per-agent) for RL environments.
- Action Hook Points: Desire selection, attention reallocation, social act choice.
- Reward Candidates: Need deltas, reputation gains, reduced uncertainty metrics.
- Future Export: Periodic snapshot serialization for offline trajectory datasets (imitation + RL training).

---

## Contributing Guidelines

Foundation established with architectural consistency:

- **Type Safety First**: Use `Normalized` for all [0.0, 1.0] values instead of raw f32.
- **Plugin Architecture**: Each domain is a self-contained plugin with comprehensive documentation.
- **Test-Driven**: All new functionality requires tests in `src/tests/` organized by domain.
- **Event-Driven**: Use events for inter-domain communication instead of direct coupling.
- **Continuous Values**: Use `Normalized` vectors for social/emotional states, not enums.
- **Documentation**: Follow the established hierarchy (current vs. historical approaches).
- **Small Systems**: Keep systems focused (< ~50 LOC) with clear `_system` suffix naming.

Draft PRs encouraged for architectural discussion before large changes.
