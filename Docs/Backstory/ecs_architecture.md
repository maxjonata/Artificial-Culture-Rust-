# ECS Architecture Fundamentals (Entity-Component-System)

## Basic Concept
The Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture is a design pattern frequently used in game development and complex simulations. It separates processing logic (Systems) from data (Components) and world entities (Entities), enabling greater flexibility, modularity, and performance.

## Main Elements

### Entities
- Basic objects that exist in the simulation world
- Act as containers for Components
- Have no behavior or data of their own
- Identified by unique IDs
- Can represent any world object: people, places, resources, abstract concepts

### Components
- Pure data structures, no behavior
- Store specific attributes and states
- Attached to entities to give them characteristics
- Can be added or removed dynamically
- Examples: position, velocity, health, inventory, beliefs, social relations

### Systems
- Contain all processing logic
- Operate on sets of entities with specific components
- Responsible for updating components
- Run on each simulation update cycle
- Can communicate with each other via events or direct queries

## Advantages for Social Simulations
- **Composition over inheritance**: allows creation of complex entities by combining simple components
- **Separation of data and logic**: makes the system easier to maintain and extend
- **Parallel processing**: systems can operate independently
- **Flexibility**: components can be added or removed at runtime
- **Scalability**: suitable for simulations with thousands of interacting entities

## Application in Social Simulations
- **Entities**: citizens, social groups, locations, resources, ideas
- **Components**: personality traits, beliefs, needs, social relations
- **Systems**: information propagation, decision making, group formation, cultural evolution

## Databases
- Starting with SLED for fast commutation and visualization but scalling will be better done with SpacetimeDB for temporal storage. Vector search still a challenge using SpacetimeDB when implementing embedding models cosine similarities.

## Specific Challenges
- Modeling emergent behaviors
- Representing abstract concepts like culture and beliefs
- Balancing simulation fidelity and computational performance
- Integrating multiple layers of interaction (instinctive, cognitive, social, cultural)
