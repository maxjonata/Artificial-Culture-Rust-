# System Structure for Social Simulation Processing

## 1. Instinct System
**Description**: Processes basic needs and automatic responses, managing physiological and instinctive components.

### Main Functions
- **Needs Monitoring**: Constantly assesses levels of hunger, thirst, energy, and health
- **Impulse Generation**: Creates primary drives based on unmet needs
- **Automatic Responses**: Produces immediate reactions to threatening environmental stimuli
- **Homeostasis**: Seeks to maintain internal balance, prioritizing the most urgent needs
- **Urgency Signaling**: Communicates critical states to higher-level systems

### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: Current state of physiological components, environmental stimuli
- **Outputs**: Primary drives, urgency signals, changes in physiological components

## 2. Emotional and Cognitive System
**Description**: Updates emotional states, generates beliefs, and shapes opinions, integrating sensory information with past experiences.

### Main Functions
- **Emotional Processing**: Generates and updates emotional states based on events and needs
- **Cognitive Evaluation**: Interprets events and information through cognitive filters
- **Belief Formation**: Develops and updates beliefs about the world and other agents
- **Decision Making**: Assesses options and selects actions based on values and goals
- **Emotional Regulation**: Modulates emotional responses based on social context and goals

### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: Instinct system impulses, social information, memories, environmental events
- **Outputs**: Updated emotional states, beliefs, opinions, preliminary decisions

## 3. Information Propagation System
**Description**: Spreads rumors and shapes reputations via social networks, simulating how information flows between agents.

### Main Functions
- **Information Transmission**: Propagates data among agents connected in social networks
- **Message Distortion**: Alters information during transmission based on cognitive biases
- **Public Opinion Formation**: Aggregates individual opinions into collective trends
- **Reputation Management**: Updates perceptions of individuals based on circulating information
- **Innovation Diffusion**: Simulates the adoption of new ideas through social networks

### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: New information, social network structure, characteristics of transmitters
- **Outputs**: Propagated information, updated reputations, opinion trends

## 4. Decision and Planning System (GOAP)
**Description**: Sets short- and long-term goals and chooses actions, using goal-oriented action planning.

### Main Functions
- **Goal Setting**: Establishes goals based on needs, values, and context
- **Action Planning**: Creates action sequences to achieve goals
- **Conflict Resolution**: Prioritizes among competing goals
- **Plan Adaptation**: Adjusts strategies based on environmental changes
- **Action Execution**: Implements chosen behaviors and monitors results

### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: Emotional states, beliefs, needs, social context
- **Outputs**: Prioritized goals, action plans, executable behaviors

## 5. Global Events System
**Description**: Records world events and triggers chain reactions, managing occurrences that affect multiple agents.

### Main Functions
- **Event Generation**: Creates occurrences based on system conditions or external triggers
- **Impact Propagation**: Determines which agents are affected by each event
- **Consequence Cascades**: Models secondary and tertiary effects of events
- **Temporal Synchronization**: Maintains temporal consistency among related events
- **Historical Logging**: Keeps a log of significant events for future reference

### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: Global system state, actions of influential agents, external triggers
- **Outputs**: Registered events, notifications to affected agents, environmental changes

## 6. Memory and Validation System
**Description**: Stores/retrieves memories and manages forgetting or questioning of information.

### Main Functions
- **Memory Encoding**: Transforms experiences into storable representations
- **Storage**: Maintains memories with different levels of accessibility
- **Retrieval**: Accesses relevant memories based on current context
- **Forgetting**: Gradually reduces accessibility of unused memories
- **Information Validation**: Assesses consistency between new information and existing memories

### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: Experiences, received information, retrieval queries
- **Outputs**: Retrieved memories, validated/questioned information, updated memories

## 7. Learning and Culture System
**Description**: Models the transmission of values, evolution of customs, and emergence of norms.

### Main Functions
- **Social Learning**: Acquires behaviors and beliefs by observation
- **Cultural Transmission**: Passes cultural information between generations and groups
- **Cultural Innovation**: Generates variations in existing practices and beliefs
- **Norm Formation**: Develops implicit rules based on recurring behaviors
- **Value Evolution**: Gradually modifies guiding principles of groups

### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: Observed behaviors, cultural artifacts, social interactions
- **Outputs**: Updated cultural practices, emerging norms, modified values
