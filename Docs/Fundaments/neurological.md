# Neurological Foundations for Social Simulation

## Neural Bases of Social Behavior

### Basic Neural Circuits
- **Limbic System**: emotional processing and memory
- **Prefrontal Cortex**: executive functions, planning, impulse control
- **Amygdala**: threat processing and fear responses
- **Hippocampus**: memory formation and spatial navigation

### Neurotransmitters and Behavior
- **Dopamine**: reward, motivation, learning
- **Serotonin**: mood, anxiety, social behavior
- **Oxytocin**: social bonding, trust, empathy
- **Cortisol**: stress response, vigilance

### Neuroscience of Decision Making
- **Reward Circuit**: value and utility assessment
- **Neural Confirmation Bias**: selective activation for congruent information
- **Somatic Markers**: bodily signals guiding decisions
- **Neural Competition**: multiple systems competing for behavioral control

### Social Neuroscience
- **Mirror Neurons**: neural basis for empathy and imitation learning
- **Neural Theory of Mind**: brain regions dedicated to understanding others
- **Social Pain**: neural overlap between physical pain and social rejection
- **Neural Contagion**: synchronization of brain activity in social interactions

### Social Information Processing
- **Facial Recognition**: specialized circuits for faces
- **Deception Detection**: neural mechanisms for identifying cheating
- **Status Processing**: neural sensitivity to social hierarchies
- **Ingroup Bias**: preferential processing for ingroup members

### Neural Plasticity and Social Learning
- **Long-Term Potentiation**: strengthening of synaptic connections
- **Neuroplasticity**: structural changes based on experience
- **Critical Periods**: time windows of heightened sensitivity to experience
- **Epigenetics**: environmental influences on gene expression

### Neural Bases of Complex Social Phenomena
- **Conformity**: suppression of error-monitoring circuits
- **Morality**: integration of emotion and cognition in moral judgments
- **Cooperation**: activation of reward circuits in prosocial behaviors
- **Group Identity**: neural modulation based on social belonging
