# Psychological Foundations for Social Simulation

## Cognitive and Behavioral Processes

### Motivation and Needs
- **Hierarchy of Needs (Maslow)**: physiological, safety, belonging, esteem, self-actualization
- **Self-Determination Theory**: needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness
- **Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation**: internal or external origin of the drive to act
- **Homeostasis**: tendency to maintain internal balance

### Emotions and Affect
- **Basic Emotions**: joy, sadness, fear, anger, disgust, surprise
- **Emotional Regulation**: ability to modulate emotional responses
- **Emotional Contagion**: transfer of emotional states between individuals
- **Valence and Arousal**: fundamental dimensions of emotional experience

### Social Cognition
- **Theory of Mind**: ability to attribute mental states to others
- **Causal Attribution**: how we explain behaviors (internal vs. external)
- **Cognitive Biases**: mental shortcuts that distort perception and judgment
- **Cognitive Dissonance**: discomfort caused by contradictory beliefs

### Personality and Individual Differences
- **Big Five Model**: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism
- **Locus of Control**: perception of control over events (internal vs. external)
- **Attachment Styles**: relationship patterns formed in childhood
- **Tolerance for Ambiguity**: ability to deal with uncertainty

### Learning and Memory
- **Classical and Operant Conditioning**: learning by association and consequences
- **Social Learning**: acquisition of behaviors by observation
- **Working Memory**: temporary storage of information
- **Episodic vs. Semantic Memory**: personal events vs. general knowledge

### Decision Making
- **Bounded Rationality**: cognitive constraints in information processing
- **Heuristics**: mental shortcuts for quick decisions
- **Loss Aversion**: tendency to avoid losses more than seek gains
- **Temporal Discounting**: devaluation of future rewards

### Social Influence
- **Conformity**: adjustment of behavior to match social norms
- **Obedience to Authority**: submission to commands from authority figures
- **Persuasion**: attitude change through communication
- **Social Identity**: self-concept derived from group membership
