# Sociological Foundations for Social Simulation

## Social Evolution and Emergent Structures

### Levels of Social Organization
- **Micro**: individual interactions, face-to-face relationships
- **Meso**: groups, organizations, local communities
- **Macro**: institutions, cultural systems, entire societies

### Mechanisms of Social Cohesion
- **Social Capital**: relationship networks and norms of reciprocity
- **Trust**: expectations about others' future behaviors
- **Social Norms**: implicit rules governing behaviors
- **Sanctions**: punishments and rewards for conformity/deviation

### Group Dynamics
- **Conformity**: tendency to adopt group behaviors
- **Polarization**: extremization of opinions in homogeneous groups
- **Groupthink**: suppression of dissent to maintain harmony
- **Diffusion of Responsibility**: decreased individual responsibility in groups

### Social Stratification
- **Hierarchies**: unequal distribution of power and resources
- **Status**: relative position within social hierarchies
- **Social Mobility**: ability to change position in the hierarchy
- **Homophily**: tendency to associate with similar others

### Cultural Transmission
- **Socialization**: process of learning norms and values
- **Rituals**: symbolic practices reinforcing collective identity
- **Collective Memory**: shared narratives about the past
- **Cultural Innovation**: emergence and diffusion of new practices

### Conflict and Cooperation
- **Social Dilemmas**: tensions between individual and collective interests
- **Coalition Formation**: strategic alliances between groups
- **Resource Competition**: disputes over scarce goods
- **Conflict Resolution**: mechanisms to restore social order

### Emergent Phenomena
- **Social Movements**: collective actions to promote change
- **Moral Panics**: exaggerated reactions to perceived threats
- **Information Cascades**: mass adoption based on observed behaviors
- **Revolutions**: rapid transformations of social structures
