# Artificial Society - Development Roadmap

This document describes the development plan for "Artificial Society", an AI simulation system for an MMORPG, built with
the Bevy Engine in Rust. The goal is to create a dynamic and emergent world, driven by agents with complex behaviors and
social interactions. **where every agent possesses the potential for significance.**

**üìÖ Last Update:** July 29, 2025
**üöÄ Current Status:** Phase 1.6 - Learning and Adaptation Systems

## üéØ **Core Architectural Philosophy**

**IMPORTANT:** The project is founded on two core principles: **Neuro-inspired Cognition** and **Equality of Potential
**.

1. **Neuro-inspired Cognition:** Agent behavior is not scripted but **emerges** from the interaction of simulated
   neural, physiological, and social systems. Knowledge is not stored as data but as the **plasticity of synaptic
   connections** between concepts.
2. **Equality of Potential:** Every agent, regardless of their initial role, operates on the same fundamental cognitive
   architecture. There are no simplified "LOD brains". A farmer has the same potential for complex thought as a king;
   their differences arise from experience, not from design limitations.

This architecture's ultimate goal is to serve as a "digital twin" environment for **training reinforcement learning
models**, where the simulation provides a rich, quantifiable observation space for ML agents to learn and optimize
complex behaviors.

## üéØ **Machine Learning Architecture Objective**

**IMPORTANT:** The main architectural objective is to create a system where agent behaviors and parameters can be
iteratively optimized via Machine Learning. The simulation should serve as a "digital twin" environment for training
reinforcement learning models. Therefore:

- üî¢ **Quantifiable Components:** All attributes must be numeric (f32, bool, Vec2) to create "observation space"
- üéÆ **Action Space Hooks:** Decision systems should facilitate future hooks for ML agent actions
- üèÜ **Reward Function Integration:** Component changes should be structured for reward calculation
- üîÑ **Modular Architecture:** Orthogonal and parallelizable systems via Bevy ECS
- üìä **Data-Driven Design:** Components and systems should be easily extensible for new behaviors
- üß† **Neuro-Inspired Cogition:** Agent behavior emerges from the interaction of simulated neural, physiological, and
  social
  systems. Knowledge is not stored as data but as the plasticity of synaptic connections between concepts.
- üß¨ **Equality of Potential:** Every agent, regardless of their initial role, operates on the same fundamental cognitive
  architecture. There are no simplified "LOD brains". A farmer has the same potential for complex thought as a king;
  their differences arise from experience, not from design limitations.

  simulations, adapted here for AI agent processing rather than visual rendering.

### 1.7.1 Waves of Reality Architecture

-   [ ] **`SimulationGrid` Resource:** Spatial partitioning system with dynamic tick rates
    -   [ ] Grid-based world subdivision for computational management

### üìä Phase 1.7 Benefits:

**üåä "Waves of Reality" Philosophy:**
This system ensures that every NPC retains their full cognitive potential regardless of their current computational
priority. Unlike traditional LOD systems that simplify distant objects, the Waves of Reality approach maintains the
intrinsic complexity of each agent while dynamically adjusting their temporal resolution. This creates a world where any
NPC can become the protagonist of their own emergent story, given sufficient player attention or systemic importance.

**‚öñÔ∏è Computational Democracy:**
The system implements "computational democracy" where processing resources are allocated based on narrative significance
rather than arbitrary limitations. NPCs near players or involved in significant events receive high-frequency updates,
while distant agents continue their cognitive processes at lower frequencies, ready to spring into full complexity when
circumstances warrant attention.

**üìä Expected Performance Gains:**

- Support for 1000+ simultaneous NPCs with full cognitive architecture
- 60-90% reduction in AI processing overhead for distant agents
- Seamless scaling based on dynamic interest distribution
- Maintained behavioral complexity without simplified agent states

### üìä Phase 8 Technical Considerations:

**üèóÔ∏è Architecture Preservation:**
The transition to 3D maintains all existing cognitive, social, and neural systems without modification to their core
logic. The ECS architecture ensures that spatial representation changes do not affect the underlying behavioral
complexity, preserving years of development in agent intelligence systems.

**‚öñÔ∏è Performance Scaling:**
The Waves of Reality system becomes even more crucial in 3D environments due to increased rendering and physics
overhead. The dynamic LOD system will adapt to manage both AI processing and visual rendering based on player proximity
and system performance.

**üß† Cognitive Mapping Evolution:**
The neural navigation system's transition to 3D represents a natural evolution rather than a fundamental redesign.
Mammalian spatial cognition already operates in three dimensions, making this adaptation biologically plausible and
computationally elegant.

## Technical Implementation - ECS Architecture

The architecture follows a hierarchical structure with 5 main layers, now enhanced with considerations for neural
navigation, dynamic simulation scaling, and future 3D evolution:

### 1. Neurological Layer

**Neurotransmitters, allostatic load, willpower, neural navigation**

**Academic References:**

- McEwen, B.S. (2007). "Physiology and neurobiology of stress and adaptation" - Foundation for allostatic load
- Doya, K. (2008). "Modulators of decision making" - Mathematical models of neurotransmitters
- Inzlicht, M., & Schmeichel, B.J. (2012). "What is ego depletion? Toward a mechanistic revision of the resource model
  of self-control." - **Updated willpower theory**
- **O'Keefe, J., & Nadel, L. (1978). "The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map."** - **Neural basis of spatial navigation**

This fundamental layer represents the biological substrate that supports all cognitive and behavioral processes of NPCs.
Here reside the neurotransmitter systems (dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin, cortisol) that modulate emotional states,
motivation and stress responses. The allostatic load system monitors the physiological cost of continuous adaptation to
the environment, accumulating "wear" when NPCs operate outside their homeostatic thresholds. The updated willpower
system follows adaptive control theory rather than simple resource depletion, making it more robust and scientifically
grounded.

**üß† Neural Navigation Integration:** This layer now includes the foundational neural circuits for spatial navigation,
including place cells, grid cells, and boundary vector cells. These neurobiological structures provide the substrate for
emergent navigation behaviors, allowing agents to develop internal cognitive maps through exploration and synaptic
plasticity rather than relying on algorithmic pathfinding.

### 2. Cognitive Layer

**Belief system, dual processing, decision making, synaptic plasticity**

**Academic References:**

- Kahneman, D. (2003). "A perspective on judgment and choice: mapping bounded rationality" - Dual processing
- Festinger, L. (1957). "A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance" - Belief system and dissonance
- Thagard, P. (2000). "Coherence in Thought and Action" - Coherence theory for belief networks
- Tversky & Kahneman (1974). "Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases" - Cognitive biases
- **Hebb, D. O. (1949). "The Organization of Behavior."** - **Synaptic plasticity foundation**

Built upon the neurological foundation, this layer implements the higher mental processes that define the "cognitive
personality" of each NPC. The dual processing system manages the constant tension between fast and intuitive responses (
System 1) versus rational and costly deliberation (System 2), modulated by neurotransmitter states and willpower levels.
The belief system maintains a complex network of knowledge, values and expectations that can conflict, generating
cognitive dissonance that needs resolution through strategies like rationalization, belief change or denial.

**üîó Synaptic Learning Integration:** The cognitive layer now incorporates Hebbian learning mechanisms that allow NPCs to
form and strengthen associations between concepts, places, and experiences. This creates a dynamic knowledge network
where frequently accessed information becomes more readily available, and unused connections decay over time, mimicking
biological neural plasticity.

### 3. Social-Cultural Layer

**Trust networks, information propagation, group dynamics**

**Academic References:**

- Granovetter, M. (1973). "The strength of weak ties" - Foundation for trust networks
- Coleman, J.S. (1988). "Social capital in the creation of human capital" - Social capital theory
- Tajfel & Turner (1979). "An integrative theory of intergroup conflict" - Group dynamics
- Girard, R. (1986). "The Scapegoat" - Scapegoating mechanisms
- Easley & Kleinberg (2010). "Networks, Crowds, and Markets" - Information propagation

This layer manages complex interactions between NPCs, creating a dynamic web of relationships that evolves continuously.
Trust networks establish preferential channels for information exchange, where source credibility dramatically
influences acceptance of new ideas. The information propagation system simulates how rumors, beliefs and knowledge
spread through the population, suffering mutations, amplifications and distortions based on individual cognitive
characteristics and social relations. Group dynamics emerge naturally from mutual trust aggregation, creating factions,
hierarchies and implicit social norms that pressure individuals toward conformity.

**üåä Waves of Reality Consideration:** Social interactions are now subject to the dynamic simulation scaling system,
where the frequency of social updates depends on proximity to interest points. However, the social network maintains its
integrity across all tick rates, ensuring relationship continuity regardless of computational priority.

### 4. Hypergraph Layer

**Dynamic nodes, chaotic feedback, emergent patterns**

**Academic References:**

- Strogatz, S.H. (2014). "Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos" - Mathematical foundation for dynamical systems
- Watts & Strogatz (1998). "Collective dynamics of 'small-world' networks" - Complex network models
- Prigogine, I. (1984). "Order out of Chaos" - Dissipative structures and self-organization
- Holland, J.H. (1995). "Hidden Order: How Adaptation Builds Complexity" - Complex adaptive systems

Representing the chaotic intersection point between all other layers, the hypergraph creates non-linear and dynamic
connections between any states of any system components. Unlike traditional networks, hypergraphs allow multiple
elements to connect simultaneously through "hyperedges", creating complex activation patterns that can propagate
cascading changes through apparently unrelated domains. This layer detects and amplifies small fluctuations,
transforming minimal differences into divergent behaviors through positive feedback loops.

**‚ö° Neural Activation Propagation:** The hypergraph layer now serves as the medium for neural activation propagation in
the navigation system, allowing activation patterns to flow between place cells, landmarks, and decision-making centers
in ways that create emergent routing behaviors.

### 5. Emergent Layer

**Emergent behavior detection, phase transitions, 3D evolution readiness**

**Academic References:**

- Anderson, P.W. (1972). "More is Different" - Emergence in complex systems
- Bar-Yam, Y. (1997). "Dynamics of Complex Systems" - Phase transition analysis
- Johnson, S. (2001). "Emergence: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities" - Emergent patterns
- Mitchell, M. (2009). "Complexity: A Guided Tour" - Complex systems and self-organization

The most abstract layer monitors and quantifies phenomena that emerge from complex interaction between all lower layers,
but cannot be predicted or explained by them in isolation. Here resides the meta-systemic intelligence that detects
collective patterns like social movement formation, sudden cultural changes, moral panics or behavioral revolutions. The
system analyzes aggregate metrics like belief distribution, social connection density, average stress levels and
cultural coherence to identify "social temperatures" that precede phase transitions.

**üèóÔ∏è 3D Evolution Monitoring:** This layer will eventually monitor the transition from 2D to 3D behaviors, detecting
when agents successfully adapt their cognitive mapping and social dynamics to three-dimensional environments, ensuring
seamless evolution of emergent behaviors across dimensional transitions.

### Data Flows:

#### **Upward Flow (Bottom-Up):**

**Neural Circuits ‚Üí Spatial Cognition ‚Üí Navigational Policy ‚Üí Emergent Movement Patterns**

> This flow now begins with fundamental neural circuits (`Place Cells`) creating spatial awareness. These neural
> activations influence cognitive processes like attention and decision-making (via `ActivationPropagation`), which
> manifest as a **navigational policy** (always move towards the highest activation). When multiple NPCs follow their
> unique learned policies, collective phenomena like crowd formation, territorial disputes, or coordinated migrations
> emerge.

**üß≠ Navigation Enhancement:** The upward flow now includes the progression from basic place cell activation to complex
route planning, allowing simple neural firing patterns to generate sophisticated spatial behaviors that influence social
dynamics and ultimately create emergent group movement patterns.

#### **Downward Flow (Top-Down):**

**Environmental Pressure ‚Üí Cultural Spatial Norms ‚Üí Cognitive Map Biasing ‚Üí Synaptic Adaptation**

> Social pressures now directly influence the **learning process** itself. Cultural norms (e.g., "avoid the dark
> forest") can act as a modulating factor on the `SynapticPlasticitySystem`, causing connections leading into "taboo"
> areas to be learned more slowly or forgotten more quickly. This demonstrates how culture can physically shape an
> individual's neural representation of the world.

#### **Lateral Flow (Hypergraph):**

  self-organization

- Wolfram, S. (2002). "A New Kind of Science" - Computational emergence in simple systems

This flow represents the most innovative and chaotic aspect of the architecture, allowing direct and non-linear
connections between any states of any components, regardless of their hierarchical position. Unlike vertical flows that
follow predictable paths, the hypergraph creates dynamic "shortcuts" based on activation patterns, temporal correlations
or unexpected resonances. For example, a specific neurotransmitter pattern in one NPC can resonate directly with group
dynamics in another social cluster, or an individual belief can instantly activate an emergent cultural norm without
passing through intermediate stages. This flow is responsible for "quantum behavioral leaps" - sudden and apparently
inexplicable changes that characterize real complex systems. It allows small fluctuations to amplify exponentially
through non-obvious paths, creating bifurcations, phase transitions and truly emergent behaviors that cannot be
predicted by linear flows. The hypergraph acts as a "complexity accelerator", ensuring the system remains dynamic,
unpredictable and capable of spontaneous self-organization.
