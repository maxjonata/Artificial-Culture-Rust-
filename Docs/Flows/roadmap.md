# Artificial Society - Development Roadmap

This document describes the development plan for "Artificial Society", an AI simulation system for an MMORPG, built with the Bevy Engine in Rust. The goal is to create a dynamic and emergent world, driven by agents with complex behaviors and social interactions.

**üìÖ Last Update:** July 28, 2025
**üöÄ Current Status:** Phase 1.6 - Optimization and ML Preparation

## üéØ **Machine Learning Architecture Objective**

**IMPORTANT:** The main architectural objective is to create a system where agent behaviors and parameters can be iteratively optimized via Machine Learning. The simulation should serve as a "digital twin" environment for training reinforcement learning models. Therefore:

- üî¢ **Quantifiable Components:** All attributes must be numeric (f32, bool, Vec2) to create "observation space"
- üéÆ **Action Space Hooks:** Decision systems should facilitate future hooks for ML agent actions
- üèÜ **Reward Function Integration:** Component changes should be structured for reward calculation
- üîÑ **Modular Architecture:** Orthogonal and parallelizable systems via Bevy ECS

## Technical Implementation - ECS Architecture

The architecture follows a hierarchical structure with 5 main layers:

### 1. Neurological Layer
**Neurotransmitters, allostatic load, willpower**

**Academic References:**
- McEwen, B.S. (2007). "Physiology and neurobiology of stress and adaptation" - Foundation for allostatic load
- Doya, K. (2008). "Modulators of decision making" - Mathematical models of neurotransmitters
- Baumeister, R.F. et al. (1998). "Ego depletion: Is the active self a limited resource?" - Willpower system

This fundamental layer represents the biological substrate that supports all cognitive and behavioral processes of NPCs. Here reside the neurotransmitter systems (dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin, cortisol) that modulate emotional states, motivation and stress responses. The allostatic load system monitors the physiological cost of continuous adaptation to the environment, accumulating "wear" when NPCs operate outside their homeostatic thresholds. Willpower acts as a limited resource that depletes with difficult decisions and regenerates with rest, directly influencing self-regulation capacity. This layer establishes the chemical and energetic foundations for all higher processes, creating individual variability in emotional response patterns and adaptation capacity.

### 2. Cognitive Layer
**Belief system, dual processing, decision making**

Built upon the neurological foundation, this layer implements the higher mental processes that define the "cognitive personality" of each NPC. The dual processing system manages the constant tension between fast and intuitive responses (System 1) versus rational and costly deliberation (System 2), modulated by neurotransmitter states and willpower levels. The belief system maintains a complex network of knowledge, values and expectations that can conflict, generating cognitive dissonance that needs resolution through strategies like rationalization, belief change or denial. Cognitive biases systematically filter and distort reality perception, creating unique "subjective realities" for each NPC and making information propagation a complex and non-linear process.

### 3. Social-Cultural Layer

This layer manages complex interactions between NPCs, creating a dynamic web of relationships that evolves continuously. Trust networks establish preferential channels for information exchange, where source credibility dramatically influences acceptance of new ideas. The information propagation system simulates how rumors, beliefs and knowledge spread through the population, suffering mutations, amplifications and distortions based on individual cognitive characteristics and social relations. Group dynamics emerge naturally from mutual trust aggregation, creating factions, hierarchies and implicit social norms that pressure individuals toward conformity. This layer also implements scapegoating mechanisms, where groups under stress channel frustration toward specific targets based on social vulnerability criteria.

### 4. Hypergraph Layer
**Dynamic nodes, chaotic feedback, emergent patterns**

Representing the chaotic intersection point between all other layers, the hypergraph creates non-linear and dynamic connections between any states of any system components. Unlike traditional networks, hypergraphs allow multiple elements to connect simultaneously through "hyperedges", creating complex activation patterns that can propagate cascading changes through apparently unrelated domains. This layer detects and amplifies small fluctuations, transforming minimal differences into divergent behaviors through positive feedback loops. The system continuously monitors temporal patterns, identifying bifurcation points where the collective system can abruptly transition between qualitatively different states, creating the unpredictability necessary for genuine emergence.

### 5. Emergent Layer
**Emergent behavior detection, phase transitions**

The most abstract layer monitors and quantifies phenomena that emerge from complex interaction between all lower layers, but cannot be predicted or explained by them in isolation. Here resides the meta-systemic intelligence that detects collective patterns like social movement formation, sudden cultural changes, moral panics or behavioral revolutions. The system analyzes aggregate metrics like belief distribution, social connection density, average stress levels and cultural coherence to identify "social temperatures" that precede phase transitions. This layer also implements self-observation mechanisms that allow the system to recognize when operating in stable versus chaotic regimes, adjusting global parameters to maintain the balance between order and chaos necessary for creativity and continuous adaptation.

### Data Flows:

#### **Upward Flow (Bottom-Up):** 
**Neurotransmitters ‚Üí Emotions ‚Üí Cognition ‚Üí Social Behavior ‚Üí Emergence**

- Freeman, W.J. (2000). "How Brains Make Up Their Minds" - Neural emergence of cognitive patterns

This flow represents the influence of biological foundations on high-order phenomena, following a natural progression from micro to macro. It begins with neurotransmitter levels that directly modulate emotional states - for example, low serotonin can induce anxiety, while high dopamine increases reward-seeking. These emotional states then influence cognitive processes: an anxious NPC may exhibit greater confirmation bias or faster System 1 processing, while a motivated NPC may invest more resources in deliberative System 2. Altered cognition manifests in modified social behaviors - stressed NPCs may be less trustworthy or more prone to social avoidance behaviors. Finally, when multiple NPCs exhibit simultaneous behavioral changes due to similar neurochemical patterns, collective phenomena emerge like social panics, mass movements or cultural changes. This flow ensures that the "biological realities" of NPCs translate into observable social complexity.

#### **Downward Flow (Top-Down):** 
**Social Pressure ‚Üí Cultural Norms ‚Üí Cognitive Dissonance ‚Üí Stress ‚Üí Neurochemistry**

- Dickerson, S.S. & Kemeny, M.E. (2004). "Acute stressors and cortisol responses" - Social stress and neurochemistry

This flow captures how macro-social forces penetrate and reshape individual NPC biology. It begins with external social pressures - like group expectations, emerging cultural norms or collective crises - that establish specific behavioral demands on individuals. These pressures crystallize into cultural norms that define what is "acceptable" or "expected" within certain social contexts. When cultural norms conflict with personal beliefs, values or natural inclinations of an NPC, cognitive dissonance arises - a psychological tension that demands resolution. This unresolved cognitive dissonance generates persistent psychological stress, which manifests physically through cortisol elevation and other stress markers. Chronic stress, in turn, alters neurotransmitter synthesis and decay patterns, creating new neurobiological "configurations". This flow demonstrates how culture and society literally "reshape" individual biology, creating feedback loops where social pressures become neurological realities.

This flow represents the most innovative and chaotic aspect of the architecture, allowing direct and non-linear connections between any states of any components, regardless of their hierarchical position. Unlike vertical flows that follow predictable paths, the hypergraph creates dynamic "shortcuts" based on activation patterns, temporal correlations or unexpected resonances. For example, a specific neurotransmitter pattern in one NPC can resonate directly with group dynamics in another social cluster, or an individual belief can instantly activate an emergent cultural norm without passing through intermediate stages. This flow is responsible for "quantum behavioral leaps" - sudden and apparently inexplicable changes that characterize real complex systems. It allows small fluctuations to amplify exponentially through non-obvious paths, creating bifurcations, phase transitions and truly emergent behaviors that cannot be predicted by linear flows. The hypergraph acts as a "complexity accelerator", ensuring the system remains dynamic, unpredictable and capable of spontaneous self-organization.

This architecture ensures complex emergence through interaction of simple systems, following the SOLID and DRY principles established in previous phases.
