# Interaction Flows between ECS Systems for Social Simulation

## Main Flows by Layers

### Instinct Layer → Cognitive Layer
- **Basic Needs Flow**
  - Origin: Instinct System
  - Destination: Emotional and Cognitive System
  - Data: Physiological urgency signals, primary drives
  - Effect: Generation of primary emotions (fear, anger) and cognitive prioritization

- **Alert and Vigilance Flow**
  - Origin: Instinct System
  - Destination: Memory and Validation System
  - Data: Environmental threat signals
  - Effect: Activation of memories relevant for survival

### Cognitive Layer → Social Layer
- **Emotional Expression Flow**
  - Origin: Emotional and Cognitive System
  - Destination: Information Propagation System
  - Data: Emotional states, formed opinions
  - Effect: Communication of internal states to other agents

- **Belief Formation Flow**
  - Origin: Emotional and Cognitive System
  - Destination: Information Propagation System
  - Data: Beliefs and event interpretations
  - Effect: Dissemination of subjective interpretations

### Social Layer → Cultural Layer
- **Norm Consolidation Flow**
  - Origin: Information Propagation System
  - Destination: Learning and Culture System
  - Data: Recurring behavior patterns, shared opinions
  - Effect: Emergence of social norms and collective values

- **Collective Reputation Flow**
  - Origin: Information Propagation System
  - Destination: Learning and Culture System
  - Data: Social evaluations of individuals and groups
  - Effect: Formation of lasting reputations and stereotypes

### Cultural Layer → Cognitive Layer
- **Cultural Influence Flow**
  - Origin: Learning and Culture System
  - Destination: Emotional and Cognitive System
  - Data: Norms, values, and cultural practices
  - Effect: Modulation of cognitive and emotional processes by cultural factors
