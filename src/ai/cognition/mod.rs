/// Cognitive processing plugin for agent decision-making and higher-order thinking.
///
/// This plugin implements the cognitive layer of the "Brain as a Society of Systems" architecture,
/// handling executive functions, decision-making, memory formation, and belief systems. It represents
/// the agent's capacity for rational thought, planning, and abstract reasoning.
///
/// # Cognitive Architecture
///
/// The cognition system is inspired by dual-process theory and implements multiple cognitive subsystems:
/// - **Executive Control**: Working memory, attention, and cognitive control mechanisms
/// - **Decision Making**: Utility-based choice selection and action planning
/// - **Memory Systems**: Episodic, semantic, and procedural memory formation and retrieval
/// - **Belief Formation**: Bayesian belief updating and knowledge representation
/// - **Planning**: Goal-oriented behavior and temporal reasoning
///
/// # Scientific Foundation
///
/// Based on cognitive neuroscience research including:
/// - Kahneman's System 1/System 2 dual-process theory
/// - Baddeley's working memory model
/// - ACT-R cognitive architecture principles
/// - Predictive processing and Bayesian brain theories
///
/// # Integration with Other Systems
///
/// The cognition plugin operates as the "executive" in the brain's society of systems:
/// - Receives processed sensory input from the `perception` system
/// - Considers physiological drives from the `physiology` system
/// - Incorporates social context from the `social` system
/// - Outputs behavioral decisions and action plans
///
/// # Components and Systems
///
/// When fully implemented, this plugin will register:
/// - `WorkingMemory`: Short-term information storage and manipulation
/// - `LongTermMemory`: Persistent knowledge and experience storage
/// - `BeliefSystem`: Probabilistic beliefs about the world state
/// - `DecisionMaker`: Utility-based action selection
/// - `GoalPlanner`: Hierarchical goal decomposition and planning
/// - `AttentionSystem`: Selective attention and cognitive resource allocation
///
/// # Performance Considerations
///
/// Cognitive processing is computationally expensive. The system uses:
/// - Bounded rationality to limit search depth
/// - Satisficing rather than optimizing decisions
/// - Attention mechanisms to focus processing resources
/// - Memory consolidation to reduce active cognitive load
