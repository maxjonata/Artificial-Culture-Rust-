/// Biological drives and homeostatic regulation plugin for agent physiology.
///
/// This plugin implements the physiological layer of the "Brain as a Society of Systems" architecture,
/// handling basic biological needs, health status, stress responses, and homeostatic regulation.
/// It represents the agent's embodied nature and the fundamental drives that motivate behavior,
/// serving as the foundation upon which higher-order cognitive processes operate.
///
/// # Physiological Architecture
///
/// The physiology system is grounded in biological realism and implements:
/// - **Homeostatic Regulation**: Maintenance of internal biological balance
/// - **Basic Needs**: Hunger, thirst, energy, sleep, and safety requirements
/// - **Stress Response**: Acute and chronic stress management (allostasis)
/// - **Health Systems**: Disease, injury, healing, and immune responses
/// - **Circadian Rhythms**: Sleep-wake cycles and hormonal fluctuations
/// - **Metabolic Processes**: Energy conversion, aging, and physical degradation
///
/// # Scientific Foundation
///
/// Based on physiological and medical research including:
/// - Homeostasis and allostasis theory (Sterling & Eyer, McEwen)
/// - Maslow's hierarchy of needs (adapted for computational modeling)
/// - Stress physiology and HPA axis function
/// - Circadian biology and chronobiology
/// - Metabolic modeling and energy balance
/// - Psychoneuroimmunology and mind-body interactions
///
/// # Allostatic Load Model
///
/// The system implements Sterling's allostatic load theory:
/// - **Homeostasis**: Normal regulatory state with stable parameters
/// - **Allostasis**: Adaptive response to stress with elevated set points
/// - **Allostatic Overload**: Pathological state from chronic stress exposure
/// - **Recovery**: Return to baseline or establishment of new equilibrium
///
/// # Integration with Other Systems
///
/// The physiology plugin acts as the "brainstem and limbic system" in the brain's society:
/// - Provides motivational drives that influence `cognition` system decisions
/// - Affects `perception` system through stress-induced attention biases
/// - Influences `social` system through health status and energy levels
/// - Generates emotional responses that modulate all other systems
///
/// # Components and Systems
///
/// When fully implemented, this plugin will register:
/// - `BasicNeeds`: Hunger, thirst, energy, sleep, safety, and social needs
/// - `StressSystem`: Acute and chronic stress tracking with allostatic load
/// - `HealthStatus`: Disease, injury, immune function, and healing
/// - `CircadianClock`: Sleep-wake cycles and hormonal rhythms
/// - `Metabolism`: Energy conversion, aging, and physical condition
/// - `EmotionalState`: Mood regulation and affective responses
/// - `PainSystem`: Nociception and pain-avoidance behaviors
///
/// # Temporal Dynamics
///
/// Physiological processes operate on multiple timescales:
/// - **Seconds**: Acute stress responses, pain reactions
/// - **Minutes**: Hunger pangs, fatigue onset
/// - **Hours**: Energy depletion, circadian phase shifts
/// - **Days**: Recovery from illness, adaptation to chronic stress
/// - **Weeks/Months**: Aging effects, long-term health changes
///
/// # Performance Considerations
///
/// Physiological simulation balances realism with computational efficiency:
/// - Uses normalized values [0.0, 1.0] for all physiological parameters
/// - Implements efficient decay and recovery curves
/// - Employs event-driven updates for significant state changes
/// - Caches frequently computed physiological interactions
