/// Social interaction and communication plugin for agent interpersonal behavior.
///
/// This plugin implements the social layer of the "Brain as a Society of Systems" architecture,
/// handling interpersonal relationships, communication, social cognition, and group dynamics.
/// It represents the agent's capacity for social understanding, cooperation, competition, and
/// cultural learning, enabling complex emergent social phenomena in the simulation.
///
/// # Social Architecture
///
/// The social system is inspired by social psychology and anthropology research:
/// - **Social Cognition**: Theory of mind, empathy, and perspective-taking
/// - **Communication**: Language processing, non-verbal cues, and information exchange
/// - **Relationship Management**: Trust, reputation, and social bond formation
/// - **Group Dynamics**: In-group/out-group behavior, social roles, and hierarchies
/// - **Cultural Learning**: Norm acquisition, social learning, and cultural transmission
/// - **Emotional Contagion**: Mood synchronization and collective emotional states
///
/// # Scientific Foundation
///
/// Based on social science research including:
/// - Social Identity Theory (Tajfel & Turner)
/// - Theory of Mind and mentalizing (Baron-Cohen, Premack & Woodruff)
/// - Social Learning Theory (Bandura)
/// - Dunbar's social brain hypothesis and cognitive limits
/// - Cultural evolution and dual inheritance theory
/// - Emotional contagion and mirror neuron research
/// - Game theory and evolutionary psychology
///
/// # Dunbar's Number and Social Limits
///
/// The system respects cognitive limits on social relationships:
/// - **Intimate bonds**: ~5 closest relationships (family/partners)
/// - **Close friends**: ~15 meaningful friendships
/// - **Stable group**: ~50 individuals with regular interaction
/// - **Cognitive limit**: ~150 individuals that can be tracked socially
/// - **Recognition limit**: ~500 faces that can be remembered
///
/// # Integration with Other Systems
///
/// The social plugin acts as the "social brain" in the brain's society:
/// - Uses `perception` system to detect social cues and interpret behavior
/// - Influences `cognition` system through social context and peer pressure
/// - Affects `physiology` system through social stress and support
/// - Generates social emotions that modulate decision-making
///
/// # Components and Systems
///
/// When fully implemented, this plugin will register:
/// - `SocialCognition`: Theory of mind and perspective-taking abilities
/// - `RelationshipTracker`: Social bonds, trust levels, and reputation
/// - `CommunicationSystem`: Language processing and information exchange
/// - `GroupMembership`: In-group identification and social roles
/// - `CulturalKnowledge`: Norms, values, and cultural practices
/// - `EmotionalContagion`: Mood synchronization and collective emotions
/// - `SocialMemory`: Episodic memory for social interactions and events
/// - `CooperationSystem`: Reciprocity, altruism, and collective action
///
/// # Emergent Social Phenomena
///
/// The social system enables complex emergent behaviors:
/// - **Social Networks**: Formation of friendship and alliance networks
/// - **Cultural Evolution**: Emergence and spread of social norms
/// - **Collective Intelligence**: Group problem-solving and decision-making
/// - **Social Stratification**: Development of status hierarchies
/// - **Conflict Resolution**: Negotiation, mediation, and peace-making
/// - **Information Cascades**: Rapid spread of beliefs and behaviors
///
/// # Performance Considerations
///
/// Social processing scales with population size and requires optimization:
/// - Uses spatial partitioning for efficient social proximity queries
/// - Implements attention mechanisms to focus on relevant social actors
/// - Employs relationship strength to prioritize social processing
/// - Caches frequently accessed social information
/// - Balances social realism with computational tractability
