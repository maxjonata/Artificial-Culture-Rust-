/// Sensory processing and world model construction plugin for agent perception.
///
/// This plugin implements the perceptual layer of the "Brain as a Society of Systems" architecture,
/// handling sensory input processing, object recognition, spatial awareness, and world model updates.
/// It serves as the primary interface between agents and their environment, transforming raw sensory
/// data into meaningful information for cognitive processing.
///
/// # Perceptual Architecture
///
/// The perception system follows principles from computational neuroscience and implements:
/// - **Sensory Processing**: Multi-modal sensory input (vision, hearing, proprioception)
/// - **Feature Detection**: Object recognition and classification
/// - **Spatial Mapping**: Environmental layout and navigation information
/// - **Temporal Integration**: Motion detection and temporal pattern recognition
/// - **Attention Filtering**: Selective attention and salience detection
/// - **Predictive Processing**: Expectation-based perception and prediction error
///
/// # Scientific Foundation
///
/// Based on neuroscience and cognitive science research including:
/// - Hierarchical predictive processing (Andy Clark, Jakob Hohwy)
/// - Bayesian perception and active inference (Karl Friston)
/// - Attention and consciousness theories (Global Workspace Theory)
/// - Embodied cognition and enactive perception
/// - Computational models of visual and auditory processing
///
/// # The Mantle of Ignorance Principle
///
/// Critical to the simulation's realism, this plugin enforces information scarcity:
/// - Agents cannot directly access other entities' internal states
/// - All information must be acquired through sensory channels
/// - Perception is subjective, noisy, and limited by attention
/// - Agents maintain their own internal world models based on observations
///
/// # Integration with Other Systems
///
/// The perception plugin acts as the "sensory cortex" in the brain's society:
/// - Provides processed sensory data to the `cognition` system for decision-making
/// - Informs the `physiology` system about environmental threats and opportunities
/// - Enables the `social` system to detect and interpret social cues
/// - Updates internal world models used by all other cognitive systems
///
/// # Components and Systems
///
/// When fully implemented, this plugin will register:
/// - `VisionSystem`: Visual processing and object detection
/// - `HearingSystem`: Auditory processing and sound localization
/// - `ProprioceptionSystem`: Body awareness and spatial orientation
/// - `WorldModel`: Internal representation of the environment
/// - `AttentionFilter`: Selective attention and salience computation
/// - `PerceptualMemory`: Short-term storage of recent perceptions
/// - `ExpectationSystem`: Predictive processing and surprise detection
///
/// # Performance Considerations
///
/// Perception is computationally intensive but critical for realism:
/// - Uses spatial partitioning for efficient proximity queries
/// - Implements attention mechanisms to focus processing
/// - Employs level-of-detail for distant objects
/// - Caches frequently accessed perceptual information
/// - Balances accuracy with computational efficiency
